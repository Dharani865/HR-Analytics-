       * Power BI or Tableau – Data visualization platform used for report creation.
       * Excel / CSV – Data source
       * Power Query - Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
       * DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - Used for calculated measures,dynamic visuals and conditional logic.
       * Data Modeling -  Relationships established among Tables(Employees,Attrition and data-dictionary)to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
       * File Format - .pbix for devolopment and .png for Dashboard previews.
       * Slicers - to explore various HR metrics.
